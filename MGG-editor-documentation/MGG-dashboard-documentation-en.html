        <p>
            Our User Dashboard allows authors, translators, and other contributors to MGG access to the articles to which they have been assigned.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Articles” on the Dashboard are sometimes whole MGG-Online articles; sometimes they are only parts of articles, which have been split up for easier
            editing. When they are published, split articles will appear together as one unbroken article.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are six lists of articles accessible from the Dashboard: <span class="operation">View all articles</span>, <span class="operation">Articles with recent messages</span>, <span class="operation">Open articles</span>, <span class="operation">Assigned articles</span>,
            <span class="operation">Collaboration</span>, and <span class="operation">Past assignments</span>. Clicking on the buttons at the top left of the screen will display the appropriate list. When you open the
            Dashboard up, it will default to <span class="operation">Open articles</span>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="article-list"> List of Articles
        </h2>
        <p>
            For articles that have been split, the <span class="operation">Section</span> column shows which part you have been assigned to. For articles that have not been split, it will always
            show “Part 0”.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two kinds of message that the system holds pertaining to an article. Public messages (and notes) are viewable to all who have been assigned to
            the article, as well as all MGG-Online editors.  A count of those messages, since the article was last published or translated, appears on the Dashboard in
            the <span class="operation">General</span> column. Private messages can only be seen by the sender and the receiver. The <span class="operation">Private</span> column shows a count of private messages to which you
            have sent or received.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on a row to see more information about an article, or (if in you have access) to edit it.  On the right, you see buttons to complete various actions,
            and two boxes (<span class="operation">Details</span> and <span class="operation">Document History</span>) with further information about the article.
        </p>
        <h2 id="buttons">Buttons
        </h2>
        <p>
            When you select an article in the dashboard, buttons will appear under the title of the article on the right side of the screen. The buttons vary depending
            on whether you have access to that particular article:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
<span class="operation">Submit</span> will give access to the article back to the editor.
        </li>
        <li>
In the case that there are more than one user (author or translator) working on one part of an article together, <span class="operation">Collaborate</span> allows one user to give
            access to another user with the same role. Access can then be passed back and forth indefinitely.
        </li>
        <li>
<span class="operation">Edit</span> opens the article in the Editor.
        </li>
        <li>
<span class="operation">View</span> opens the article for viewing or printing only.
        </li>
        <li>
<span class="operation">Add Note</span> allows you to write a note or message relating to the selected article. A message is addressed to a particular user or editor in the
            system. A note is not addressed to anyone in particular. If a message is marked <span class="operation">Private</span>, only the writer and the recipient of that note will be able to
            see it.
        </li>
        <li>
<span class="operation">Approve</span> allows a user (author or editor) to approve an article for publication.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can only edit articles you have been given permission to access.  Only one user can have access to an article at a time. You can view and add notes to
            any article to which you have been assigned.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2 id="doc-history">Document History
        </h2>
        <p>
            To read notes and messages relating to an article, click <span class="operation">See more</span> at the bottom of the Document History section.
