            <h1>Documentation for FontoXML/MGG</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h2 id="general">General instructions</h2>
            <p class="new">FontoXML is not a word processor. While some aspects of FontoXML will be intuitive if you are used to Microsoft Word or Google Docs, do not expect all text in FontoXML to appear the way it will when published. To see a preview of the published text, please use the <span class=" operation">View</span> button in the Editorial System.</p>
            <h3 id="tagging">Tagging</h3>
            <p>When you click in a particular paragraph or item, highlighting will appear to show which text has been tagged. That tagging will appear in shades of blue, gray, red, and yellow, depending on what tag is applied.</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot" id="Picture28" src="images/image001.png" /></p>
            <p>The tagging highlighted in yellow without a box around it is a formatting tag. Replacing these tags with semantic tags will greatly benefit users of MGG Online. Please change these tags if possible. </p>
            <p><img class="screenshot" id="Picture29" src="images/image002.png" /></p>
            <p>Any text underlined in pink means there is an editorial comment left by an editor and will not be published.</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot"  id="Picture1" src="images/image003.png" /></p>
            <p>The comment will show when you click on the text.</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot"  id="Picture2" src="images/image004.png" /></p>
            <p>The tabs and menus were designed to put commands in a logical order. However, commands from one menu might be useful in many circumstances. Some commands are duplicated in various menus. </p>
            <h3 id="location-bar">Location bar</h3>
            <p>On the bottom of the screen there is a display that shows your location in the document. When the cursor is placed on highlighted text, this display will show you which tag the highlighting represents. In the example below, the cursor is in a <span class="operation">Birth</span> tag.</p>
            <img class="screenshot"  id="Picture3" src="images/image005.jpg" alt="location-bar" />
            <p class="new">It is important to monitor the location bar while using FontoXML, for while text will not appear as you expect it to, if the label in the location is correct, the published text will be correct.
            </p>
            <h3 id="right-tabs">Tabs on the right</h3>
            <p>There are three tabs that can be viewed by clicking on the buttons <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> , <span class="operation">STRUCTURE</span>, AND <span class="operation">SOURCE</span> all the way to the right side of the screen. Two of them—<span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> and <span class="operation">STRUCTURE</span>—will be useful to authors in certain situations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <span class="operation">STRUCTURE</span> tab shows the main sections of the article. The name of the section in which the cursor is currently placed in in boldface. This tab is useful for moving quickly from one section of an article to another.</li>
                <li>The <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> tab. Some tags have variable properties. For instance, users can specify the language for many tags. For a phrase tagged <span class="operation">foreign</span>, click on the plus sign (<img
						class="inlineImage" id="Picture10"
						src="images/image006.png"
					 />) icon next to the <span class="operation">language</span> property, choose the appropriate language, and then click <span class="operation">Save properties</span>. To change the language of a whole document from German to any other language, put the cursor at the very top of the article (it will become horizontal), then click on <span class="operation">Text</span> in the <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> tab. Then change the language, and click <span class="operation">Save properties</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="paragraphs-sections">Paragraphs and sections</h3>
            <h4 id="new-paragraph">Creating a new paragraph</h4>
            <p>To create a new paragraph, click <span class="operation">Enter</span> or <span class="operation">Return</span> at the end of an existing paragraph, or section heading, or click <span class="operation">Enter/Return</span> in an empty list item.</p>
            <h4 id="new-section">Creating a section</h4>
            <p>To create a new section, place the cursor anywhere in an existing section, and select the appropriate type of section from the <span class="operation">Structure</span> menu on the <span class="operation">Insert</span> tab. The new section will appear at the end of the section where your cursor is.</p>
            <h4 id="new-subsection">Creating a subsection</h4>
            <p>To create a subsection, first create a new section after the section in which the subsection is to appear. Then open the <span><span class="operation">STRUCTURE</span> tab. There you will see an ellipsis (<img class="inlineImage" id="Picture33" src="images/image007.png" alt="ellipsis-icon.png" />) icon. Click on the ellipsis. To change the new section to a subsection of the section above it, click <span class="operation">Move right</span> (If there is existing text in the section that you want to move to a new subsection, create the new section <i>above</i> the existing section and convert the existing section in to a subsection of the new section with <span class="operation">Move right</span>. You can change the type of each section in <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span>.)</span></p>
            <h4 id="change-section-number">Changing a section number</h4>
            <p>To add a number to a section, or to change the number of a section, first select the <span class="operation">Section</span> button on the location bar at the bottom of the page. Then open the <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> on the right side of the page, and change the <span class="operation">Number</span> property.</p>
            <h4 id="update-toc">Updating topic article Tables of Contents</h4>
            <p>When changes are made to the sectional organization of topic (Sachteil) articles, the section headings listed at the beginnings of those articles will also need to be updated. These TOCs are formatted as lists; see §B2.2 below for more on editing lists.</p>
            <p>To create a link between a section heading in the TOC and that section’s location in the article itself, open the <span class="operation">Insert</span> tab and select <span class="operation">Link</span>, <span class="operation">Local Link</span>. When the dialogue box appears, begin typing the section heading in the <span class="operation">Filter by Text</span> box. Once the appropriate section heading appears under <span class="operation">Items in this document</span>, select it and click <span class="operation">Insert</span>. </p>
            <h3 id="eraser-icon">The eraser icon</h3>
            <p>The eraser icon <img class="inlineImage" id="Picture4" src="images/image008.png" alt="eraser" /> , found at the top left of FontoXML, allows you to erase tags. Place the cursor anywhere in the document and the tag you are on (as shown in the <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> tab) will be erased. No text will be erased—only tagging. If multiple tags appear on top of one another, you must erase all of the tags at the lowest level first before erasing the tags that contain them.</p>
            <h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
            <p>Any Command that includes the word “template” will insert a series of gray boxes into the text that look like this:</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot" id="Picture30" src="images/image009.png" /></p>
            <p>You will find these templates in two places. One, <span class="operation">MGG/ Bibliogaphy/Bibliographic Citation</span>, has templates for the most common types of bibliographic citaiton: <span class="operation">Monograph title template</span>, <span class="operation">Periodical article Template</span>, <span class="operation">Collection article template</span>. </p>
            <p>Type directly into the gray boxes to complete the template.  Any box can be left empty and nothing will appear in the text. However, any text or punctuation outside of the boxes must be deleted if you do not want it to show in the text. If you have additional information in bibliographic citations that are not covered by the existing templates, you can simply type that information in and then tag it with the appropriate tag.</p>
            <h2 id="fonto-tabs">FontoXML Tabs</h2>
            <h3 id="mgg-tab">MGG tab: Tagging words, phrases, or passages in the text</h3>
            <p>This is the tab you will be using most often. It contains the most-commonly used tags for tagging MGG text. It contains six menus: Names, Quotation, Music, Bibliography, Works, and Titles.</p>
            <h4 id="names">Names</h4>
            <h5 id="person">Person</h5>
            <p><span class="operation">Person</span> is used to tag and format names of, and information about persons. It is used to tag the beginning of Personenteil articles about persons, and of sections within Personenteil articles about families, and can be used at any point in the text to tag a name that appears with biographical information such as birth and death dates.</p>
            <p><span class="operation">Person</span> should always contain other, more specific tags: at the very least, it will contain <span class="operation">Personal name</span>. It might also contain <span class="operation">Birth</span>, <span class="operation">Death</span>, and <span class="operation">Occupation</span>. <span class="operation">Personal name</span> itself can contain any parts of a name: <span class="operation">Forename</span>, <span class="operation">Surname</span>, <span class="operation">Surname prefix</span>, <span class="operation">Generational name component</span>, <span class="operation">Role name</span>, and <span class="operation">Additional name</span>. Use <span class="operation">Variant personal name</span> for any variant spellings, Romanizations, or other forms. If information about birth, death, or occupation appears, tag the entire excerpt as a <span class="operation">Person</span>. Then tag the name with <span class="operation">Personal name</span> and other information as follows:</p>
            <p>Text without any tagging:</p>
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture5" src="images/image010.png" />
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture18" src="images/image011.jpg" alt="location-paragraph" />
            <p>First, tag the entire first sentence with <span class="operation">Person</span>:</p>
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture31" src="images/image012.png" />
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture20" src="images/image013.jpg" alt="location-person" />
            <p>As soon as an excerpt is tagged as  <span class="operation">Person</span>, a <span class="operation">Taxonomy entry</span> window will appear, where you can connect that person with his or her entry in the RILM database.  Start typing the surname in the <span class="operation">Search Taxonomy</span> box, and select the correct person if found. Then click <span class="operation">Apply</span>, even if no match has been found.</p>
            <p>Then, <span class="operation">Birth</span> for “13. Juli 1922 in Tagoloan, Oriental Misamis/Philippinen” and <span class="operation">Death</span> for “5. Juni 1991 in Fremont/Cal.”:</p>
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture34" src="images/image014.png" />
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture22" src="images/image015.jpg" alt="location-birth" />
            <p>Then <span class="operation">Date</span> for “13. Juli 1922” and “5. Juni 1991”:</p>
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture35" src="images/image016.png" />
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture12" src="images/image017.jpg" alt="location-date" />
            <p>Then <span class="operation">Place name</span> for the place of birth and the place of death:</p>
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture36" src="images/image018.png" />
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture14" src="images/image019.jpg" alt="location-placeName" />
            <p>Then <span class="operation">Occupation</span> (two times) for “Komponistin” and “Dirigentin”: </p>
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture37" src="images/image020.png" />
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture16" src="images/image021.jpg" alt="location-occupation" />
            <p>Link any instance of <span class="operation">Person</span> to RILM by searching in the dialog box. Search for names in the format <i>Surname, Forname</i>.</p>
            <h5 id="birth-death">Birth and Death information</h5>
            <p>Within a <span class="operation">Person</span> tag, tag all information about a person’s birth with <span class="operation">Birth</span>, all information about their death in <span class="operation">Death</span>, all information about their baptism in <span class="operation">Baptism</span>, and all information about burial in <span class="operation">Burial</span>. Within these tags, use <span class="operation">Date</span> and <span class="operation">Place name</span>. There is no need to insert a * or a † in <span class="operation">Birth</span> or <span class="operation">De ath</span>. They will be generated automatically. Existing asterisks and daggers must be deleted.</p>
            <h5 id="org-names">Names of Organizations</h5>
            <p>The name of an organization—especially one that is the subject of an article—can be tagged with <span class="operation">Organization name</span> or <span class="operation">Variant organization name</span>. Performing organizations, such as orchestra or rock groups can be tagged <span class="operation">Performing group</span>, and will be rendered in italics.</p>
            <h5 id="place-names">Place Names</h5>
            <p>Place names, when they appear in <span class="operation">Person</span> or in <span class="operation">Performance</span>, can be tagged <span class="operation">Place name</span>.</p>
            <h4 id="quotations">Quotation</h4>
               <img class="screenshot"
                             src="images/image022.png" />
            <br />
            <p>In this system, users do not use quotation marks; instead, there are a few tags that will produce them when text is presented. For quotations from other sources, use <span class="operation">Quotation</span>. <span class="new">Note also that all passages tagged with <span class="operation">Quotation</span> will be surrounded with <i>double</i> quotation marks in FontoXML, even when the quotation is nested within another quotation. Nested quotations will render correctly in <span class="operation">View</span> in the Editorial System, and in the final published article.</span></p> 
            <p>If the quotation is followed by a reference, first tag both the quotation and reference with <span class="operation">Cited quotation</span>, and then tag the quotation with <span class="operation">Quotation</span> and the reference with <span class="operation">Reference</span>. If the reference refers to an item listed elsewhere in the article, use <span class="operation">INSERT</span>/<span class="operation">Link</span>/<span class="operation">Local link</span> instead of <span class="operation">Reference</span>.</p>
            <p>For so-called, used <span class="operation">So-called</span>. For incipit titles, use <span class="operation">Incipit title</span> from the Titles menu. For titles within titles, simply use one <span class="operation">title</span> within the other; the “child” title will automatically be rendered in quotes.</p>
            <blockquote><i>Schubert’s</i><i> »Der Tod und das Mädchen«: Analytical and Explanatory Notes on the Song D 531 and the Quartet D 810</i></blockquote>
            <p>The <span class="operation">Quotation marks</span> command, which can be found in the <span class="operation">Formatting</span> menu, creates quotation marks in the text without signifying the purpose of the quotation marks. Use them if no other command seems appropriate.</p>
            <p><span class="operation">Line group</span> and <span class="operation">Verse line</span> can be used together to format verse, as in the following example. Each line is tagged with <span class="operation">Verse line</span> and the entire strophe (<span class="operation">Line group</span>):</p>
            <p><img class="screenshot" id="Picture7" src="images/image023.png" alt="line-group" /></p>
            <h4 id="list-menus">List menus: Bibliography and Works</h4>
            <p>The Bibliography and Works menus are designed for creating and tagging works lists, bibliographies, and other similar lists. To create a citation in one of these lists, add a <span class="operation">Bibliographic citation</span> or <span class="operation">Works citation</span>, and add information within that citation. There are also three <a href="#templates">templates</a> for bibliographic citations available which are visible when you put your cursor over <span class="operation">Bibliographic citation</span> in the <span class="operation">Bibliography</span> menu.</p>
            <p>Use <span class="operation">Author</span>, along with any name parts (<span class="operation">forename</span>, <span class="operation">surname</span>, etc.) for authors. Use <span class="operation">Author</span> for specialized roles such as librettist or producer as well. Use <span class="operation">Editor</span> for editors. If an editor bears responsibility for an item and therefore appears before the title, select <span class="operation">Editor – primary</span>. If an author appears after the main title in the entry, select <span class="operation">Author – secondary</span>. Use other commands, such as <span class="operation">Translator</span> or <span class="operation">Compiler</span> when appropriate; use <span class="operation">Editor</span> for any other person whose contribution to the work is secondary.</p>
            <p>Tag the title with the proper title type (in the Titles menu). Also, many title types have a “secondary” variant. If the title is secondary within the reference, e.g., it is the title of a collection in which the primary work is published, choose the “secondary” variant of the title type. That will cause the title to be rendered in Roman type.</p>
            <div class="optional">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="operation">Publication place</span> will contain the place of publication.</li>
                <li><span class="operation">Date</span> will contain the date of publication. For dates of composition, render the date in parentheses and select <span class="operation">Composition date</span> from the <span class="operation">Works</span> menu.</li>
                <li>A numbered edition can be tagged as <span class="operation">Edition (superscript)</span>.</li>
                <li>Tag page ranges, volume numbers, etc. with the appropriate designation in the Bibliographic scope section of the <span class="operation">Bibliography</span> menu.</li>
                <li>A DOI should be tagged with <span class="operation">DOI</span></li>
                <li>Tag web addresses (URLs) with <span class="operation">Web address</span></li>
                <li>Tag opus numbers and other catalog numbers with <span class="operation">Catalog number</span>. Make sure to tag both the abbreviation (“op.”, “K.”) and the number.</li>
                <li>The instrumentation can be tagged with <span class="operation">Instrumentation</span>. All instrumentation for a particular work would go in one <span class="operation">Instrumentation</span> tag.</li>
                <li>A dedication or dedicatee can be tagged with <span class="operation">Dedication</span>.</li>
                <li>A key in a works list can be tagged with <span class="operation">Musical key</span>.</li>
                <li>For information about a particular performance of a work, use <span class="operation">Performance</span>, <span class="operation">Ur-performance</span>, or <span class="operation">First performance</span></li>
                
                <li>References to RISM can be tagged with one of two tags: <span class="operation">RISM Series B/I</span> and <span class="operation">RISM library siglum</span>. For Series B/I, substitute a slash before the number of the record. It will be converted into a superscript for publication. For example, if “RISM 1610/16” is entered in the editor, it will appear as “RISM 1610<sup>16</sup>” in the published text.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="titles">Titles</h4>
            <p>Titles, whether they appear in a prose section or in a works list or bibliography, should be tagged with a tag from the Titles menu. Select the appropriate option, and the text will be formatted correctly. <span class="operation">Title</span> will generate italicized type.</p>
            <p>Titles within titles should also be tagged this way. Formatting will be set automatically.</p>
            <h4 id="formatting">Formatting</h4>
            <p>The <span class="operation">Formatting</span> menu contains various tags for text that is either italicized or set in quotation marks. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="operation">Mentioned</span>, <span class="operation">So-called</span>, and <span class="operation">Foreign text</span> should all be preferred to <span class="operation">Italic</span> or <span class="operation">Quotation marks</span>.</li>
                <li><span class="operation">Musical note name</span> will tag and italicize a pitch class.</li>
                <li><span class="operation">Pitch name</span> formats a note name with an octave, such as <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> or <i>cis</i><sup>1</sup>. There is no need to format numbers as subscripts or superscripts within <span class="operation">Pitch name</span>, as they will be formatted automatically in publication.</li>
                <li>When adding <span class="operation">Foreign text</span>, you will be prompted to enter the language of the text and a value for <span class="operation">render</span>. Only enter a value for render if the text should <i>not</i> be italicized.</li>
                <li><span class="operation">Note</span> captures text that is parenthetical and therefore formatted differently from the surrounding text. Unless indicated otherwise through the <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> tab, the contents of <span class="operation">Note</span> will always be rendered in Roman type. It will be used often in the following case:  After a works or bibliography heading, there is often a parenthetical note describing the sources of the list to come. This note should be tagged <span class="operation">Note</span> within the <span class="operation">Heading</span>:

            <span class="operation">Note</span> will also often be used for bracketed asides within quotations and titles, as in the following example:

                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture8" src="images/image030.png" />
                            <img class="screenshot" id="Picture41" src="images/image031.png" />
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="insert-tab">Insert tab</h3>
            <p>On the <span class="operation">INSERT</span> tab you can insert sections, special characters, musical examples, figures, and tables into the text. Along with two menus, <span class="operation">Structure</span> and <span class="operation">Link</span>, that allow the addition of new sections and references, there are eight commands along the top menu bar: <span class="operation">List</span>, <span class="operation">Figure</span>, <span class="operation">Music example</span>, <span class="operation">Image</span>, <span class="operation">Musical symbol</span>, <span class="operation">Special character</span>,  <span class="operation">Gap</span>, <span class="operation">Editorial note</span>, and <span class="operation">XML</span>.</p>
            <h4 id="structure">Structure</h4>
            <p>The Structure menu contains the most frequently used sections for both Sachteil and Personenteil articles. There is no difference in the system between a section and a subsection. To create a subsection, simply move one section within another (see §A4.3 above).</p>
            <p>To insert a new paragraph, position the cursor directly before the place where the new paragraph is to begin and press <span class="operation">Enter</span>.</p>
            <p>For general instructions on sections, see §A4 above.</p>
            <p>Each article begins with a <span class="operation">Heading section</span>. This section contains a paragraph with the title of the article. If the article is about a person or a family, that title should be further tagged with <span class="operation">Person</span>. Within <span class="operation">Person</span>, each name should be tagged first with <span class="operation">Personal name</span> and then a more specific designation, such as <span class="operation">Surname</span> or <span class="operation">Forename</span>. (This is because, while the heading usually only references on person, that person is sometimes known by multiple names.)  If there is a table of contents (or a listing of family members), a <span class="operation">Contents section</span> also appears within the <span class="operation">Heading section</span>. For lists of family members, the <span class="operation">Contents</span> section will contain a <span class="operation">Section heading</span> (for “Familie:”) and a Paragraph for the list of names. Those names need not be further tagged in this section. </p>
            <p>To add or change the number of a section, use the <span class="operation">number</span> field of the <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> tab. Make sure you are on <span class="operation">Section</span> in the breadcrumb menu when you do this, rather than <span class="operation">heading</span>.</p>
            <p>To add an article author, first insert an <span class="operation">Authors section</span> and then a <span class="operation">Document author</span>.  An <span class="operation">Authors section</span> can be inserted at the close of any section or at the end of the article.</p>
            <h5 id="article-authors">Article Authors</h5>
            <p>MGG Article authors will be tagged in <span class="operation">Personal name</span> within <span class="operation">Document author</span>. Please capitalize names of authors following proper orthographic conventions.</p>
            <h4 id="list">List</h4>
            <p>To create a list, start a new paragraph, then click the <span class="operation">List</span> button. Press <span class="operation">Enter</span> to create a new list item.</p>
            <p>To change the hierarchical level of a list item, press <span class="operation">Tab</span> or <span class="operation">Shift</span>+<span class="operation">Tab</span>. <span class="operation">Tab</span> moves the list item to the right and <span class="operation">Shift</span>+<span class="operation">Tab</span> moves the list item to the left.</p>
            <h5 id="toc">Table of contents</h5>
            <p>To insert a table of contents in a topic article (Sachteil), </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a <span class="operation">Contents section</span> within the <span class="operation">Heading section</span>.</li>
                <li>Then add a <span class="operation">Section heading</span> with the text “Inhalt:”</li>
                <li>Create a list with <span class="operation">List</span>.</li>
                <li>Change the bullet to a number or letter in the <span class="operation">number</span> field of the <span class="operation">PROPERTIES</span> tab.</li>
                <li>The number must be changed for each subsequent item in the table of contents.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="figure">Figure</h4>
            <p>To insert a Figure, including an image, click the <span class="operation">Figure</span> button. Then browse for the image and click <span class="operation">upload</span>. Once the filename appears in the box, select it and click <span class="operation">select file</span>. You will then be able to add a heading, such as “Figure 3” and a caption.</p>
            <h4 id="music-example">Music Example</h4>
            <p>A <span class="operation">Music example</span> is equivalent to a <span class="operation">Figure</span>, except that it contains an excerpt of notated music. To insert a musical example, click <span class="operation">Music example</span> and follow the directions above for <span class="operation">Figure</span>.</p>
            <h4 id="image">Image</h4>
            <p><span class="operation">Image</span> inserts a <i>inline</i> image. It should be used for images of symbols that cannot be added with <span class="operation">Special character</span> or <span class="operation">Musical symbol</span>.</p>
            <h4 id="link">Link</h4>
            <h5 id="hyperlink">Hyperlink</h5>
            <p><span class="operation">Hyperlink</span> allows you to create a link to a Web URL. Enter the full URL in the text. Then select the URL and click <span class="operation">Link/Hyperlink </span>. A dialog box will appear, where you must enter the URL again.</p>
            <h5 id="local-link">Local link</h5>
            <p>Local links are links to other places in the document you are working in. They are used to link in-text references to items in works lists or bibliographies. </p>
            <p><span class="operation">Local link</span> will trigger a screen to appear, where you can select a location to link to. For instance, for a quote followed by a reference such as (T. Guiard 1906). Select this whole reference, click <span class="operation">Local link</span>, and search for “<span>T. Guiard</span>, <i>Conferencia dada por Don Teófilo Guiard en la Salón de la Sociedad</i>…” from the Literatur section. Select that passage and click <span class="operation">Insert</span>.</p>
            <p>Note that if an article has been split, and you are linking to a location in a different split part, you must use <span class="operation">Cross link</span>.</p>
            <h5 id="cross-link">Cross link</h5>
            <p class="new">All cross links (cross references between articles) will be added by the MGG editorial staff.</p>
            <h4 id="musical-symbol">Musical symbol</h4>
            <p><span class="operation">Musical symbol</span> allows you to insert any of almost 2400 musical symbols. They are organized by “range”, and the ranges can be sorted numerically (so that more commonly used ranges generally appear at the top) or alphabetically. These symbols come from the <a href="http://www.smufl.org/">Standard Music Font Layout</a> (SMuFL). You can also search for a character in the box labeled “Filter labels and characters.”</p>
            <h4 id="special-character">Special character</h4>
            <p><span class="operation">Special character</span> allows you to insert non-musical special characters. The tool is similar to <span class="operation">Insert symbol</span> in Microsoft Word or the Character Map in Windows. They are organized by Unicode range, which can be sorted numerically (so that more commonly used ranges generally appear at the top) or alphabetically. You can also search for a character in the box labeled “Filter labels and characters.” Special characters can also be inserted by copying them from another application, such as Microsoft Word, and pasting them directly into FontoXML.</p>
            <h4 id="editorial-note">Editorial note</h4>
            <p><span class="operation">Editorial note</span> allows authors, editors, and other users to make comments in the text. (This serves the same purpose as Comment, but appears inline in the text.) They are highlighted yellow in FontoXML and will never be published if accidentally left in the text. Simply tag any text as <span class="operation">Editorial note</span> or insert an <span class="operation">Editorial note</span>, place the cursor in it, and start typing.</p>
            <h4 id="insert-xml">Insert XML (Pasting text from Word)</h4>
            <p>This feature is still in development, but we have created a temporary work-around. The feature will soon be easier to use, but this will work for now.</p>
            <p>In order to paste from word, prepare the .doc or .docx document in the following manner:</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Take out all headings, tables and images so that the Word document consists of only paragraphs and/or non-numbered (bulleted) lists.</li>
                <li>Save the document.</li>
                <li>Go to <a href="http://mgg-edit.rilm.org/word-conv/"
                             >http://mgg-edit.rilm.org/word-conv/</a> in a Web browser.</li>
                <li>Select Choose file, then find the Word file you wish to convert (.doc or .docx).</li>
                <li>Open the file with Notepad (on a PC), TextEdit (on a Mac), or any other text editor. (Do not add line breaks or spaces to the document.)</li>
                <li>For paragraphs, Copy any amount of text that starts with “&lt;p&gt;” and ends with “&lt;/p&gt;”, or</li>
                <li>For lists, copy any amount of text that starts with “&lt;item&gt;” and ends with “&lt;/item&gt;”. </li>
                <li>Select <span class="operation">XML</span> in the FontoXML <span class="operation">INSERT</span> tab.</li>
                <li>Paste you text (using Ctrl + V) and click <span class="operation">Apply</span>.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="table-tab">Table tab</h3>
            <h4 id="table">Table</h4>
            <p>A “table” in this system has neither a caption nor a number.  If you need a caption or number use <span class="operation">Table figure</span> (See 3.2 below).To insert a table, use the <span class="operation">Table</span> button on the <span class="operation">TABLE</span> tab, and choose the number of rows and columns. You can always add or subtract columns from a table later with the <span class="operation">Row</span> and <span class="operation">Column</span> menus.</p>
            <h4 id="table-figure">Table figure</h4>
            <p>A table figure in this system is a table with a caption and/or a heading.  The “Heading” field is for a label such as “Tabelle 3”. The “Caption” is for a description of the table.</p>
            <h3 id="view-tab">View tab</h3>
            <h4 id="section-hierarchy">Section hierarchy</h4>
            <p>Turning on <span class="operation">Section hierarchy</span> shows the hierarchy of sections using visual bars and indenting on the left-hand side. This is especially useful for long articles with complex structures.</p>
            <h4 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h4>
            <p>Turning on <span class="operation">Whitespace</span> will show a dot (&#8729;) in the location of every space.</p>
            <h4 id="source">Source</h4>
            <p>Turning on <span class="operation">Source</span> displays the underlying XML code of the article.</p>

            <h4 id="show-changes">Show changes</h4>
            <p>Turning on <span class="operation">Show changes</span> will show all text added (underlined in green) and deleted (underlined in red) since the last published version of the article. Placing your cursor anywhere in this underlined text will show when the change was made and who made it. Changes can be accepted or rejected only by editors.</p>
            <h4 id="show-comments">Show comments</h4>
            <p>Turning on <span class="operation">Show comments</span> will show comments left since the last published version of the article. The presence of a comment is signified by text underlined in pink. Place your cursor anywhere on that text to view the comment.</p>
            <h4 id="add-comment">Add comment</h4>
